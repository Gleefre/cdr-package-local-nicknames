\section{Issue 9 (Empty package local name)}
\label{sec:org811b5f6}
\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:orgdfdcf70}
It is not clear whether it should be allowed to use the empty string \texttt{""} as a
local nickname, and in the case it is allowed, whether it should affect the
keyword symbol syntax \texttt{:xxxx}.
\subsection{Examples}
\label{sec:org367dfe7}
\begin{verbatim}
(defpackage #:foo
  (:use #:cl)
  (:local-nicknames ("" #:cl)))

(in-package #:foo)

(package-name (symbol-package ':*package*))
; => "KEYWORD"  (sbcl, ccl, ecl, abcl, clasp, lispworks)
; => "COMMON-LISP"  (acl)

(package-name (symbol-package '||:*package*))
; => "KEYWORD"  (ecl, clasp, lispworks)
; => "COMMON-LISP"  (sbcl, ccl, acl)
; abcl errors
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Current behavior}
\label{sec:org26b31c4}
sbcl, ccl:
\texttt{:xxxx} is read as a keyword;
\texttt{||:xxxx} is read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed \texttt{""}.

ecl, clasp, lispworks:
Both \texttt{||:xxxx} and \texttt{:xxxx} are read as a keyword.

acl:

Both \texttt{:xxxx} and \texttt{||:xxxx} are read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed
\texttt{""} which is a \emph{global nickname} for the \texttt{\#:KEYWORD} package, but can be shadowed
by a \emph{local nickname}.

abcl:
\texttt{:xxxx} is read as a keyword;
\texttt{||:xxxx} syntax cannot be read (attemts result in an error).
\subsection{Proposal ALLOW-KEEP-KEYWORDS}
\label{sec:orgf364c2a}
The \texttt{""} local nickname should be explicitely allowed. \texttt{:xxxx} should be always
read as a keyword regardless of package names or nicknames. \texttt{||:xxxx} should be
read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed by \texttt{""}.
\subsection{Proposal ALLOW-FUN}
\label{sec:org5b47a46}
The \texttt{""} local nickname should be explicitely allowed. Both \texttt{:xxxx} and \texttt{||:xxxx}
should be read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed by \texttt{""}.
