\section{Issue 9 (Empty package local name)}
\label{sec:orgc4a3c34}
\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:org8d18f5a}
It is not clear whether it should be allowed to use \texttt{""} as a local nickname,
and in the case this is allowed, whether it should affect the \texttt{:xxxx} syntax.
\subsection{Examples}
\label{sec:org460e7f6}
\begin{verbatim}
(defpackage #:foo
  (:use #:cl)
  (:local-nicknames ("" #:cl)))

(in-package #:foo)

(package-name (symbol-package ':*package*))
; => "KEYWORD"  (sbcl, ccl, ecl, abcl, clasp, lispworks)
; => "COMMON-LISP"  (acl)

(package-name (symbol-package '||:*package*))
; => "KEYWORD"  (ecl, clasp, lispworks)
; => "COMMON-LISP"  (sbcl, ccl, acl)
; abcl errors
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Current behavior}
\label{sec:org69b379e}
sbcl, ccl:
\texttt{:xxxx} is read as a keyword;
\texttt{||:xxxx} is read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed \texttt{""}.

ecl, clasp, lispworks:
\texttt{||:xxxx} and \texttt{:xxxx} are read as a keyword.

acl:
\texttt{:xxxx} and \texttt{||:xxxx} are read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed \texttt{""}.
\texttt{""} is by default a global nickname for the \texttt{\#:KEYWORD} package.

abcl:
\texttt{:xxxx} is read as a keyword;
\texttt{||:xxxx} syntax cannot be read (attemts result in an error).
\subsection{Proposal ALLOW-BUT-KEEP-KEYWORDS}
\label{sec:org36abaac}
The \texttt{""} local nickname should be explicitely allowed. \texttt{:xxxx} should be always
read as a keyword regardless of package names or nicknames. \texttt{||:xxxx} should be
read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed by \texttt{""}.
\subsection{Proposal ALLOW-FUN}
\label{sec:org4a197b5}
The \texttt{""} local nickname should be explicitely allowed. Both \texttt{:xxxx} and \texttt{||:xxxx}
should be read as a symbol in the package named or nicknamed by \texttt{""}.
