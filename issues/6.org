#+options: toc:nil

* Proposal 6
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: proposal-6
  :END:
  Add ~:local-nicknames~ option to ~make-package~ similar to ~defpackage~. See
  [[#make-package][make-package]].
** Currently
   ecl: takes keyword parameter, but segfaults on incorrect usage + doesn't
   have it in docstring. Also API differs :/

   acl: has it

   abcl, sbcl, ccl, clasp: don't have it.
