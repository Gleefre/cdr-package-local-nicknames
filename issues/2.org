* Issue 2
  See [[#print-read-consistency][PRINT-READ consistency]].
** Example
   #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
   (defpackage #:a (:use) (:export #:+))
   (defpackage #:b (:local-nicknames (#:a #:cl)))
   (let ((*package* (find-package '#:b)))
     (print 'a:+))
   ; => a:+ everywhere
   ;; but in #:b package a:+ would refer to cl:+
   #+END_SRC
   #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
   (defpackage #:a (:use) (:export #:+))
   (defpackage #:b (:use) (:export #:+))
   (defpackage #:c (:use) (:local-nicknames (#:a #:b) (#:b #:a)))
   (let ((*package* (find-package '#:c)))
     (print 'a:+))
   ; => b:+  (sbcl, ccl, abcl)
   ; => a:+  (clasp, acl, ecl)
   ;; but in #:c package a:+ would refer to b:+
   #+END_SRC
** Currently
   sbcl, ccl, abcl: print symbol with package name when all package's names
   and nicknames are shadowed by /current package/'s /local nicknames/.

   ecl, acl, clasp: don't print with local nicknames at all.
