* Issue 1.
  Inconsistency between return values of ~add-package-local-nickname~ and
  ~remove-package-local-nickname~. First always returns /designated package/,
  second one returns /true/ if a nickname was removed (but it is not specified
  what exactly is returned). (Somewhat similar functions from the standard -
  ~use-package~ and ~unuse-package~ always return ~T~ - their api is
  consistent.)
** Proposal
   - ~add-package-local-nickname~ should return /designated package/ if a new
     nickname was added and ~NIL~ otherwise (if it already existed).
   - ~remove-package-local-nickname~ should return /designated package/ if
     nickname was removed and ~NIL~ otherwise.
** Currently
   sbcl, ccl, ecl, acl, abcl, clasp: ~add-package-local-nickname~ always returns
   /designated package/.

   sbcl, ccl, ecl, acl, clasp: ~remove-package-local-nickname~ returns ~T~ on
   success and ~NIL~

   abcl: ~remove-package-local-nickname~ returns package nicknamed by the
   removed nickname on success and ~NIL~.  [ That seems nice ]
