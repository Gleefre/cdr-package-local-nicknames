* Issue 5
  It is not clear whether it is valid to have a /local nickname/ in a package
  shadowing its own name or nickname.

  Now: SBCL signals an error, but that doesn't make much sense, especially if a
  /local nickname/ shadows the /global nickname/ of a package and not its
  name. And it is possible to achieve a /local nickname/ shadowing a /global
  nickname/ or the /package name/ by renaming the package.
** Example
   #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
   (defpackage #:a (:use) (:local-nicknames (#:a #:cl)))
   ; => error  (sbcl, ccl, abcl)
   ; => ok  (ecl, acl, clasp)
   #+END_SRC
** Proposal
   It should be allowed, but a warning might be signaled.
** Currently
   sbcl, ccl, abcl: not allowed.

   ecl, acl, clasp: allowed.
