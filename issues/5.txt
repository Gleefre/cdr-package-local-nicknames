  It is not clear whether it is valid to have a /local nickname/ in a
  package shadowing its own name or nickname.

  Now: SBCL signals an error, but that doesn't make much sense,
  especially if a /local nickname/ shadows the /global nickname/ of a
  package and not its name. And it is possible to achieve a /local
  nickname/ shadowing a /global nickname/ or the /package name/ by
  renaming the package.


1.1 Example
───────────

  ┌────
  │ (defpackage #:a (:use) (:local-nicknames (#:a #:cl)))
  │ ; => error  (sbcl, ccl, abcl)
  │ ; => ok  (ecl, acl, clasp)
  └────


1.2 Proposal
────────────

  It should be allowed, but a warning might be signaled.


1.3 Currently
─────────────

  sbcl, ccl, abcl: not allowed.

  ecl, acl, clasp: allowed.
