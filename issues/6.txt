  Add `:local-nicknames' option to `make-package' similar to
  `defpackage'. See make-package.


1.1 Currently
─────────────

  ecl: takes keyword parameter, but segfaults on incorrect usage +
  doesn't have it in docstring. Also API differs :/

  acl: has it

  abcl, sbcl, ccl, clasp: don't have it.
