══════════

  Inconsistency between return values of `add-package-local-nickname'
  and `remove-package-local-nickname'. First always returns /designated
  package/, second one returns /true/ if a nickname was removed (but it
  is not specified what exactly is returned). (Somewhat similar
  functions from the standard - `use-package' and `unuse-package' always
  return `T' - their api is consistent.)


1.1 Proposal
────────────

  • `add-package-local-nickname' should return /designated package/ if a
    new nickname was added and `NIL' otherwise (if it already existed).
  • `remove-package-local-nickname' should return /designated package/
    if nickname was removed and `NIL' otherwise.


1.2 Currently
─────────────

  sbcl, ccl, ecl, acl, abcl, clasp: `add-package-local-nickname' always
  returns /designated package/.

  sbcl, ccl, ecl, acl, clasp: `remove-package-local-nickname' returns
  `T' on success and `NIL'

  abcl: `remove-package-local-nickname' returns package nicknamed by the
  removed nickname on success and `NIL'.  [ That seems nice ]
